Practicing machine learning on data from Kaggle.com

# Where to get the data
I am currently working on the data from the exoplant hunt from the NASA Kepler project. The link to the data is here:
https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data

The data was too big to upload to github, so you will have to get it from there if you want to work along.
My code is also sloppy, because I am using Spyder and can run code bit by bit to test things out. I try to write good enough comments to explain my random blocks of code
